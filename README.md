# PadhaiDunia â€” Converted Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript

This project was automatically converted from a Vite + React + TypeScript codebase into a Next.js App Router project.

What I changed:
- Created `app/` with `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, and `not-found.tsx` that wrap the original React pages.
- Copied original `src/`, `public/`, Tailwind and PostCSS configs into the Next project.
- Added `next.config.js` and basic `package.json` for Next.js.
- Kept TypeScript path alias `@/*` -> `src/*` by retaining `tsconfig.json`.

To run locally:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Build: `npm run build`
4. Start: `npm start`

Notes / manual follow-ups you may need to do:
- Some dependencies from the original project (Framer Motion, react-query, lucide-react, etc.) must be added to the new `package.json`. Review the original `package.json` for the full list of dependencies and install them.
- Vite-specific plugins or code may need small adjustments (e.g., environment variables naming or absolute imports at build-time).
- I preserved Tailwind config and CSS; if global styles don't load, ensure `app/layout.tsx` imports the correct CSS file (it's set to import `src/index.css`).

If you want, I can now:
- Merge the original `package.json` dependencies into the Next project's `package.json` so it is runnable immediately.
- Try to run `npm install` and `npm run build` here and fix any TypeScript issues I encounter (I can run them and show logs).

Let me know which next step you prefer.
